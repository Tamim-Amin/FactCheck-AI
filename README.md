# 📰 FactCheck AI

**FactCheck AI** is a Machine Learning application designed to detect potentially fake news articles based on linguistic patterns. Built with Python, Scikit-Learn, and Streamlit, it offers both a model training pipeline and a user-friendly web interface for real-time analysis.

## 🚀 Features

- **Machine Learning Model:** Utilizes a Random Forest Classifier to distinguish between real and fake news.
- **Natural Language Processing:** Implements text preprocessing techniques including Stemming, TF-IDF vectorization, and Stopword removal.
- **Web Interface:** An interactive Streamlit dashboard allowing users to paste news text and get instant credibility feedback.
- **High Accuracy:** The model achieves approximately 97% accuracy on the test dataset.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Web Framework:** [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn (Random Forest, TF-IDF)
- **NLP:** NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- **Data Manipulation:** Pandas
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

##  Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/tamim-amin/factcheck-ai.git

cd factcheck-ai

Create a virtual environment (Optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate  
On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


##  Usage

### 1. Training the Model
If you want to retrain the model or generate the .pkl files yourself:

- Ensure train.csv is in the project directory.
- Open model_training.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
- Run all cells.

This will generate two files: vector.pkl and model.pkl.

### 2. Running the Web App
To start the application locally:


streamlit run app.py


Once running, your browser will open (usually at http://localhost:8501).

- Paste the content of a news article into the text area.
- Click " Analyze News".
- The app will display whether the news is likely Real or Fake.

##  Model Details
The project follows this pipeline:

**Preprocessing:**
- Removal of non-alphabetic characters.
- Lowercasing.
- Tokenization.
- Porter Stemming (reducing words to their root form).
- Removal of English stopwords.

**Feature Extraction:**
- TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is used to convert text data into numerical vectors.

**Classification:**
- Random Forest Classifier is used for prediction.
- Label 0: Fake News
- Label 1: Real News

##  Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset containing news articles labeled as reliable or unreliable.

- **Columns used:** text, label
- **Labels:** 1 (Real), 0 (Fake)
